coralnet-bleaching-classifier-development repository README

This repository contains code used to develop a CoralNet classifier to automate annotations of coral bleaching: "Point_Annotator_Raster_v1.3.R"

The script serves as a tool to generate additional targeted annotations, which can later be uploaded to CoralNet. The script currently contains labels for the CREP-HAWAII BLEACHING v3 CoralNet Source; however, it can be altered to work for other simple labelsets.
